This repository is a repository to generate a description for each sub-sector indexes. There are three indexes that will be generated which are, **P/E Value, Health & Resilience Index, & Growth Index**.

The output of the script will be directly updated into sectors's database, and it will updated periodically using the scheduler from Github Action.

These are some example of the LLM generated description for **Oil, Gas, & Coal sub-sector**

- P/E Value
> The Oil, Gas & Coal sub-sector is typically considered cyclical due to its dependence on global economic conditions. Historically, the P/E values for this sector have been moderate to high. The current higher P/E value compared to last year may be influenced by factors such as increased demand for energy, geopolitical tensions, and inflation concerns. Among the 23 companies in the sector with favorable P/E ratios below the market average, [#INPS.JK]PT Indah Prakasa Sentosa Tbk.[\#INPS.JK], [#ABMM.JK]ABM Investama Tbk[\#ABMM.JK], and [#INDY.JK]Indika Energy Tbk[\#INDY.JK] are particularly undervalued. The sector's P/E value in Indonesia may be influenced by factors such as government policies, energy demand, and commodity prices, reflecting its impact on the broader Indonesian economy.
- Health & Resilience Index
> The Oil, Gas & Coal sub-sector in Indonesia has shown significant growth in the past year, with a 32.85% increase in average Year on Year (YoY) quarter earnings changes and a 1657.91% increase in average YoY quarter revenue changes. This has placed the sub-sector at 16th and 1st for earnings rank and revenue rank respectively compared to other sub-sectors. [#DEWA.JK]Darma Henwa Tbk[\#DEWA.JK] leads in YoY earning growth and revenue growth, while [#ITMA.JK]SUMBER ENERGI ANDALAN Tbk[\#ITMA.JK] boasts the highest net profit margin. However, the sector's growth may be affected by fluctuating global oil prices, regulatory uncertainty, and environmental concerns. Regulatory challenges unique to the Oil, Gas & Coal sub-sector in Indonesia include licensing issues, production-sharing agreements, and environmental impact assessments.
- Growth Index
> In the last 30 days, the Oil, Gas & Coal sub-sector in Indonesia has seen worse average price changes compared to the overall IDX. This could be due to factors such as fluctuating global oil prices and regulatory challenges in the industry. Despite this, 1.22% of companies in this sub-sector are newly listed this month, indicating potential barriers to entry such as high capital requirements and strict regulations. Additionally, only 16 out of 82 companies in this sub-sector have seen positive price changes in the last 30 days. Factors such as geopolitical tensions and environmental regulations can uniquely impact the health of the Oil, Gas & Coal market in the Indonesia index.
