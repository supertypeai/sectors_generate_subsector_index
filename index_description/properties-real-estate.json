{"pe_description": "The Properties & Real Estate sub-sector in Indonesia has a P/E ratio of 6.85, which is lower than the average IDX P/E ratio. This indicates that the sub-sector is currently undervalued compared to the overall market. The sub-sector's P/E ratio has also declined compared to last year, suggesting that investors are becoming less optimistic about its growth prospects. Within the sub-sector, there are eight companies that outperform the average P/E ratio, including '###Pudjiadi Prestige Tbk####', '###Star Pacific Tbk####', and '###PT Pakuan Tbk####'. These companies are considered to be undervalued based on their P/E ratios. On the other hand, '###PT Repower Asia Indonesia Tbk.####' is considered to be overvalued based on its P/E ratio and should be avoided by investors. Factors that could influence growth within the Properties & Real Estate sub-sector in Indonesia include government policies, economic conditions, interest rates, and the overall demand for real estate.", "health_description": "The Properties & Real Estate sub-sector in Indonesia, comprising 92 companies, has demonstrated resilience by outperforming the IDX in terms of average price changes over the past 30 days.
